> **Classic eight queens problem — visualized in C and C++.**

The eight queens puzzle: place 8 queens on a chessboard so that no two attack each other. This project finds all **92 solutions** and displays them visually.

**Tech Stack:** C, C++, WinAPI, MFC

<br />

## About this project

This project was built as a hands-on way to learn Windows GUI programming and compare two different frameworks side by side: **WinAPI** in C and **MFC** in C++. The same classic puzzle was implemented twice so the trade-offs in structure, abstraction, and development style could be explored directly.

<br />

## Implementations

### MFC Version (C++)

Built with **C++ and MFC**. Created in 2000.

### C Version (WinAPI)

Built with **C and Windows API**. Created in 2006.

## Overview

This project demonstrates two different approaches to Windows GUI programming:
- **WinAPI** — low-level Windows programming in pure C
- **MFC** — Microsoft Foundation Classes in C++

Both versions solve the same mathematical puzzle and render solutions graphically.
